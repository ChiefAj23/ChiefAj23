# 👋 Hey, I'm Abhijeet Solanki

**Software Engineer (SRE / AI / ML) • Adversarial ML Researcher • Builder of Practical AI Systems**

I design, break, and harden intelligent systems.

- 🧠 ML / AI: adversarial robustness, XAI, anomaly detection, LLM-powered systems  
- 🚦 Autonomous systems: securing perception (camera, LiDAR, fusion) against real-world attacks  
- ☁️ Cloud & SRE: Azure, Kubernetes/AKS, containers, CI/CD, incident response  
- 🛠 Engineering: Python, C#, FastAPI, React/TS, platform & tooling work  

📍 Based in the Nashville, TN area · **4+ years** across SRE, backend, and applied ML.  
💼 Currently: working as a **Software Engineer on SRE/Platform-style problems** (Azure, AKS, automation, reliability).

## 🧩 What I’m building

### 🔊 AI Voice Compliance Auditor

A full-stack app (FastAPI + Python + React + TS) that turns raw voice recordings into **actionable compliance & coaching insights**:

- Scores every conversation on **compliance, tone, and quality (0–100)**  
- Detects **toxicity, interruptions, missing disclosures, wrong language usage**  
- Extracts **intent, topics, action items, and summaries** for busy managers  
- Triggers **alerts via email + webhooks** (Slack/Teams, etc.)  
- Uses **SHAP** for **explainability**, so teams can see *why* a call was flagged  
- Supports **multiple languages** for global ops teams  

> Designed for Ops / CX / Compliance leaders who want to move beyond random spot-checks and review *every* conversation intelligently.

---

## 🔬 Research Overview

My research spans **machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and autonomous agent systems**, with a core focus on the intersection of:

- Perception systems (camera, LiDAR, sensor fusion)  
- Explainable AI (XAI)  
- Adversarial machine learning & robustness  

I work on enabling intelligent systems to **reliably perceive and interpret complex environments**, while developing **strategies to secure them against real-world threats**.

Ongoing research explores the **security and robustness of camera + LiDAR fusion models** in autonomous vehicles and **edge-deployed AI systems**. Notable contributions include:

- Laser-based adversarial **attack & detection frameworks**  
- Real-time **anomaly and attack detection** for AV perception  
- **Lightweight defense mechanisms** optimized for embedded platforms (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson)

> Some submitted papers are not listed due to the double-blind review process and will appear after acceptance.
