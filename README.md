## 🧩 What I’m building

### 🔊 AI Voice Compliance Auditor

A full-stack app (FastAPI + Python + React + TS) that turns raw voice recordings into **actionable compliance & coaching insights**:

- Scores every conversation on **compliance, tone, and quality (0–100)**  
- Detects **toxicity, interruptions, missing disclosures, wrong language usage**  
- Extracts **intent, topics, action items, and summaries** for busy managers  
- Triggers **alerts via email + webhooks** (Slack/Teams, etc.)  
- Uses **SHAP** for **explainability**, so teams can see *why* a call was flagged  
- Supports **multiple languages** for global ops teams  

> Designed for Ops / CX / Compliance leaders who want to move beyond random spot-checks and review *every* conversation intelligently.

---

## 🔬 Research Overview

My research spans **machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and autonomous agent systems**, with a core focus on the intersection of:

- Perception systems (camera, LiDAR, sensor fusion)  
- Explainable AI (XAI)  
- Adversarial machine learning & robustness  

I work on enabling intelligent systems to **reliably perceive and interpret complex environments**, while developing **strategies to secure them against real-world threats**.

Ongoing research explores the **security and robustness of camera + LiDAR fusion models** in autonomous vehicles and **edge-deployed AI systems**. Notable contributions include:

- Laser-based adversarial **attack & detection frameworks**  
- Real-time **anomaly and attack detection** for AV perception  
- **Lightweight defense mechanisms** optimized for embedded platforms (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson)

> Some submitted papers are not listed due to the double-blind review process and will appear after acceptance.
